/**
 * Whether a step's `$response.body#/pointer` reads something the operation's response actually
 * documents.
 *
 * **The claim is about the DOCUMENT, not about the wire.** An object schema with `properties` and no
 * `additionalProperties: false` permits members it does not name, so a pointer at an undocumented one
 * might still find a value at run time. It is reported anyway, because a workflow output is a promise
 * to a consumer and the document is where that promise lives: a field the response schema does not
 * describe is one no generated client has and no reader can find. Either the pointer is wrong or the
 * field is undocumented, and both are the author's to fix.
 *
 * **Silent wherever the schema cannot refute it.** A response with no schema, an empty one, an object
 * that names no properties, an array with no `items` — each says nothing about the member, and a
 * report there would fire where nothing can be done. Measured before it was written: no schema in the
 * golden corpus is closed, so a rule that only spoke about closed objects would have had zero firings.
